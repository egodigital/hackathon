# Hackathon by e.GO Digital

Dear participants,

In this document you will find all summarized details from the presentation this morning. For all futher questions we have coaches present at the event. In case you have a question concerning your code or the pitch, someone will be able to give you some support. Please do not hesitate to ask us – that is what we are here for! 😀

We are delighted to have you here and wish you a great experience at this event!

## The Task

The e.GO life is generating, collecting and processing serveral data per second. Those data could be very valuable for us. Especially when you think of developing new innovative business models. Your task is to develop value-adding services for the e.GO Life and its user considering the provided data. 

## Delivery of the projects & pitching

The delivery of the project will mainly be via Github. There you can upload your files. Additionally, we will need a documentation of your work. This should include:

* Your names
* The title of your project
* A description of 
  * What the project can do/is supposed to do
  * Which problem it solves
  * How you implemented this technically
  * Which data you are using
* Also think about adding screenshots and pictures
* Feedback sheet

**Deadline** for your results is on Friday 4pm. You will have to pitch your idea in a 3-minutes-presentation. A jury will evaluate all presentations through aspects like degree of innovation, UX/UI and simplification. Keep that in mind and become one of the qualified teams for the final pitching session. The overall winning team will be honored and is getting an attractive price.
